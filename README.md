## Unique Design Features

Designed for low-vision readers, certain letters and numbers can be hard to distinguish from one another. Atkinson Hyperlegible Pro differentiates common misinterpreted letters and numbers using various design techniques: B vs. 8, 1 vs. L vs. l vs. I. Recognizable Footprints: Character boundaries are clearly defined, ensuring understanding across the visual-ability spectrum.

> `Q vs G, E vs F, p vs q, i vs r, O vs 0`

Differentiated letterform’s: Similar letter pairs are differentiated from each other to dramatically increase legibility. Unambiguous Characters: designed to increase legibility and distinction.

> `ER79jr Vsa36`

Exaggerated forms: Shaping of letters is exaggerated to provide better clarity. Opened Counterspace: Open areas of certain letters are expanded to provide greater distinction.

> `aGbgrpqu Åö8ij%?¡:`

Angled spurs and differentiated tails: Increase recognition and define distinctive style. Circular Details: Links to the history of Braille Institute and braille dots.

## Flipping the Zero

By default the zero remains with a backslash `\` this was done to prevent confusion with the Danish Ø however, when pairing the typeface with a monospace that only supports a forwardslash `/` zero, this may create a cognitive dissonance problem. On that occasion you might want to flip the zero by adding `font-variant-numeric: slashed-zero;` to your CSS file.

```css
body {
  font-family: "Atkinson Hyperlegible Pro", "Atkinson Hyperlegible", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 100%;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-variant-numeric: slashed-zero;
}
```
