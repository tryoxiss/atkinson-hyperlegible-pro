## Overview

Atkinson Hyperlegible Pro is an updated and extended version of the original typeface, which was initially designed for The Braille Institute and named after its founder, J. Robert Atkinson. It was specifically designed to improve character recognition and legibility for low-vision readers by incorporating distinctive and unambiguous letterforms. The typeface was a Winner of Fast Company’s 2019 Innovation By Design Award.

* Four fonts, including two weights (regular, italic, bold, bold italic)
* An additional 88 glyphs supporting 90 languages
* 1,820 total glyphs across all fonts, 455 per font
* Improve legibility and readability for low vision readers
* Improve kerning for visual aesthetics
* Includes ligatures for `fi ff ffi fl ffl`
* Alternative reversed number zero `0`

## Unique Design Features

Designed for low-vision readers, certain letters and numbers can be hard to distinguish from one another. Atkinson Hyperlegible Pro differentiates common misinterpreted letters and numbers using various design techniques: B vs. 8, 1 vs. L vs. l vs. I. Recognizable Footprints: Character boundaries are clearly defined, ensuring understanding across the visual-ability spectrum.

> `Q vs G, E vs F, p vs q, i vs r, O vs 0`

Differentiated letterforms: Similar letter pairs are differentiated from each other to dramatically increase legibility. Unambiguous Characters: designed to increase legibility and distinction.

> `ER79jr Vsa36`

Exaggerated forms: Shaping of letters is exaggerated to provide better clarity. Opened Counterspace: Open areas of certain letters are expanded to provide greater distinction.

> `aGbgrpqu Åö8ij%?¡:`

Angled spurs and differentiated tails: Increase recognition and define distinctive style. Circular Details: Links to the history of Braille Institute and braille dots.

## Flipping the Zero

By default the zero remains as it is however you can flip the zero by adding
`font-variant-numeric: slashed-zero;` to your CSS file.

    body {
      font-size: 100%;
      font-family: "Atkinson Hyperlegible Pro", sans-serif;
      font-weight: 400;
      font-variant-numeric: slashed-zero;
    }

And thats it the zero has been flipped!!
